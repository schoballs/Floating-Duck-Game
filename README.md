In this extra-long tutorial, I'll break down the source for Monster Wants Candy, a multi-platform game my colleague and I built with Phaser, the HTML5 game engine. In this way, you'll gain a practical introduction to the engine, and will learn concepts you can use to build your own HTML5 mobile and browser games.
